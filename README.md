# Accoredian Control and App

This React sample app contains an accessible Accordian Control and is based on recommendations from
https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-faq/. 

It is inside of an application for easier UI testing.

## NOTE

The content for this accordian controller is hardcoded, but should be fed in using props and come from a file or database. 
Obviously hardcoding the questions and answers inside the control does not work.
